# A Comparative Analysis of Exposure to Respiratory Hazards and School Performance in Southern California.

## Intro
This section shall contain the literature review elements in addition to reasoning behind the research topic selection

Air toxins from industrial pollution have significantly adverse effects on human health outcomes. *insert more information about air toxins + citations)* Riverside County, the largest county in California's Inland Empire, is known for its high levels of air pollution and air toxics exposure. The effects of such exposure to human health such as respiratory function have been thoroughly examined, with the region notably containing rates of pediatric asthma that exceed California health and safety standards. (*insert citations here*) There is existing literature linking air toxics exposure to decreased academic performance. In a study of school children in China, researchers found a significant association between air pollution, particularly levels of NO2, and poorer results on neurobehavioral tests designed to measure the childrenâ€™s sensory, motor, and psychomotor functions (Wang et al., 2009). It is important to note, however, that exposure to pollutants and decreased academic performance are not necessarily the result of SES variables. A recent study assessing the association between environmental toxicants and _____

## Data
This section shall contain information around the data sets, the methods, and why particular methods were used

(Preeti & Laura) 
The data tha was use in our methods includes the EJScreen data from the year 2020. The EJScreen data comes from the EPA and has valuable information on environmental justice data. The Variable taht we choose to use in our map is the D_RESP_2 which represents the air toxics respiratory hazard index. Furthermore, we data that we refined is the riverside county. 
Include how the index:  
Shortcomings: 

The second dataset was used was th NCES for the school district data from 2018 to 2019 academic school year. Specifically, this dataset entails the locations of the schools in a given school district.  

The third dataset, we implemented into our project is the ACS or American Community Survey from the year 2018. This dataset entails demographic variables []

The four dataset that we complied is the SEDA data; this data entails standardized test scores that were collected from the 3rd grade to the 8th grade in math and reading language arts or RLA. The school years range from 2008 to 2009 and 2017 to 2018. 
Why did we select the outcome variable how was it measured/estimated in the code? 

## Methods: [Laura...] 
Spatial analysis 
Applied the Voroni Method:  
Why did we chose that method over simple map:  

## Policy Recommendation (generalize)
(Wajiha/Laura) 
The analysis can be contributed to other counties, we have given step by step analysis. Great to extend to other areas . Laying a foundation for future researchers. 

## Results
This section shall contain the results as well as data visualizations, tables and analysis.

## Discussion and conclusions
Include the importance/relevance of the study: [Esteban] 
This section shall discuss whether the results were in line with existing research and anticipated results, how the study may be improved, policy recommendations (with research backing them) and highlighting the need of further research regarding environmental exposure and academic performance
