You are going to find my literature review summaries on the HACK.MD website. Let me know if you guys have questions on the HACK.md
summaries I included. Thank you guys. 


Actually, also adding it here.
3. [**How does air quality affect the willingness of graduate students to stay? Evidence from Beijing city, China**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620308064?casa_token=4vpCEs4gx84AAAAA:1HlR6NkQv0shFWPxbfsxktYSZnqcwjLtErBr1BfjDhazmtGbAoGZDwVLjX6NDEvDXFvYVhf6Fw)
    * Objective: Previous literature mainly focuses on the impact of air pollution on human health and society. However, it is rare to specially study the effect of urban air pollution on the willingness of local college students to stay in Beijing after graduation.
    * Issue: This study focuses on the impact of air quality on the willingness of college graduate students to stay in Beijing and continue with transformation and upgrading of the city. To keep talent in China.
    * Main Findings: The confounding variable of "Public Resources" have the most significant impact on the willingness to stay in Beijing. (This study focuses on the impact of air quality on the willingness of college graduate students to stay in Beijing). As opposed to "cost of living" it has a negative relationship on the willingness to stay in Beijing as it becomes pricey to stay in the city thus damaging the long-term development of Beijing's economy.
    * Notes: The second article was more interesting as it compared postgraduate students and seeing if they moved away from a heavily polluted area (China) or stayed. The article mentions that this is an important factor to consider as China's development has grown over the past decade and the dramatic development of the city is due to a great extent of the various kinds of talent graduate students bring. I bring this article up because it was interesting how they gauged air quality and an outcome they wanted to measure. Maybe we could measure education outcomes in part with this view where educational talent is not leaving and staying in a particular area and adding to the growth where they stay. (talent stays within a region). Even if the study took place in China, I'm sure we can find similar patterns in the IE that could shape how we take up our proposal.

4. [**Something in the air? Air quality and childrenâ€™s educational outcomes**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775716303703?casa_token=ugeiFu02DpMAAAAA:P15cDtFA3bgdeg3-2FniGlhUfUHSGnX3HdTJL8XVao134fFflk_wIx5mOBFca2HT66XmEQb9lg)
    * Objective: The paper contributed to an emerging literature on the relationship between ambient air quality and the development/academic achievement of children.
    * Issue: Understanding the full effect of air quality is vital in knowing the full cost of  human made air pollution that might not be taken into consideration and also estimating the benefits and implications of policies to limit the threat of negative air qualities.
    * Main Findings: Lifetime exposure to pollen has significant negative effects on reading and math ability at the start of kindergarden. For children reporting a history of asthma, the relationship is large between negative air quality and math and reading achievement.  One recommendation is that: low-income areas are often relatively old, and less likely to be equipped with air conditioning. And, poor students are less likely to receive diagnosis and treatment for health problems.
    * Notes: The first article was more cut and dry where the article measures air quality/air pollen and seeing educational outcomes. What they find is that air quality has some effect on educational test scores (math/reading) but not a very strong relationship.
