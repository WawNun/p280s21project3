# Notes on Policy Recommendation 
1. Cap and Trade 
* **Summary:** 
    * The Cap-and-Trade Program/regulation permits the state to put a cap on facilities that emit carbon dioxide (or air pollutants), in an attempt to decrease the level of pollution in the air. 
    * The author references [a study] that reveals how the Cap and Trade has increased the level of pollution in disadvatanged communities (mainly low-income and minority neighborhoods) as they bear the heavy weight of being exposed to harmful air pollutants. 
    * Since 2017, the Cap-and-Trade was modified to disallow the state and local government agencies to regulate "facility emissions at their source."
    * Therefore, preventing agencies such as the California Air Resources Board and "local air districts" from targeting specific pollutors. .  
    * The author argues that the California State Legislature should remove the ban in order to allow state and local agencies to regulate air pollution within their local vicinity. 
    * State and local governments can specifically target facilities to reduce their carbon emissions in ares where vulnerable communities are most impacted; by reducing carbon emissions in those areas.
