## Notes on Policy Recommendation 
1. California’s Cap-and-Trade Program Has Proven Effective – Now Let’s Make it Equitable  
* **Summary:** 
    * The Cap-and-Trade Program/regulation permits the state to put a cap on facilities that emit carbon dioxide (or air pollutants), in an attempt to decrease the level of pollution in the air. 
    * The author references [a study] that reveals how the Cap and Trade has increased the level of pollution in disadvatanged communities (mainly low-income and minority neighborhoods) as they bear the heavy weight of being exposed to harmful air pollutants. 
    * Since 2017, the Cap-and-Trade was modified to disallow the state and local government agencies to regulate "facility emissions at their source."
    * Therefore, preventing agencies such as the California Air Resources Board and "local air districts" from targeting specific pollutors. .  
    * The author argues that the California State Legislature should remove the ban in order to allow state and local agencies to regulate air pollution within their local vicinity. 
    * State and local governments can specifically target facilities to reduce their carbon emissions in ares where vulnerable communities are most impacted; by reducing carbon emissions in those areas.

## Legislation Related to Environmetal Justice in California

### SB 1000
Low-income communities and communities of color often bear a disproportionate burden of pollution and associated health risks.  Environmental justice seeks to correct this inequity by reducing the pollution experienced by these communities and ensuring their input is considered in decisions that affect them. "Environmental justice" is defined in California law as the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and incomes with respect to the development, adoption, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. (Cal. Gov. Code, § 65040.12, subd. (e). 

In an effort to address the inequitable distribution of pollution and associated health effects in low-income communities and communities of color, the Legislature passed and Governor Brown signed SB 1000 in 2016, requiring local governments to identify environmental justice communities (called “disadvantaged communities”) in their jurisdictions and address environmental justice in their general plans.  This new law has several purposes, including to facilitate transparency and public engagement in local governments’ planning and decision making processes, reduce harmful pollutants and the associated health risks in environmental justice communities, and promote equitable access to health-inducing benefits, such as healthy food options, housing, public facilities, and recreation.
