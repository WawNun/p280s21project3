```
import quilt3
b = quilt3.Bucket("s3://spatial-ucr")
b.fetch("epa/ejscreen/ejscreen_2020.parquet", "./ejscreen_2020.parquet")
ejscreen = pd.read_parquet('ejscreen_2020.parquet')

```
tracts = gpd.read_parquet("s3://spatial-ucr/census/acs/acs_2018_tract.parquet")
```

 ## :speech_balloon: Questions
- How do we pull student test performance from SEDA Website? 
    - Pending Decisions on which type of school (public, private, charter school)
    - Time period for analysis 
- How do we define school districts? 
- One of the things that we were considering was looking at the locations of warehouses to help look at the impact that toxic hazard has on students performance. Would you recommend that we go about that route or would looking at the Environment Justice dataset be enough? 
----

## :dart: Tasks 

Due Date: `05/15/2021`
- Each member to finish literature review summary of the 2 articles.
- Data sets for analysis (2 person per dataset).

  **Note: Details of each tasks are organized in the projects section of the repo.**

## :date: Group Meeting Log
----
`5/06/2021`
- [x]  **Group Meeting** 

 *Agenda: Finalized the project proposal in HackMD file.*
 
 ----
 
`4/23/2021` 
 - [x]   **Group Meeting** 

*Agenda: Discussion and review of data and literature for the study.*

 Potential Forms of Measurements
   -  Air Pollution ( what should be the ideal measure from EJscreen?)
   -  Demographics, Ethniticy, Gender Income Variables were provided in SEDA.
   
 Points Raised by Group Members:
   - Esteban: For Causality 
   - Laura: Cons for Causality, maybe looking at associations would be easier.  
   - Wajiha: potential air quality data from non-profit. Looking at Inland Empire 
    
  Future Deliverables:
   -  Project Proposal will be finalized in HackMD link and then transferred to GitHUb.
   
------

`04/21/2021`
 - [x]  **Inclass Group Meeting** 

*Agenda: Brainstroming Session/ Class Discussion*

List of questions generated during the discussion session:
 1. What environmental factors significantly impact educational attainment?
    - Ex. aerosol particulate matter/respiratory hazards
3. In what ways do environmental factors impact educational success?
4. Are minorities and people of color more likely to be affected by environmental toxic exposure? 
5. How should we measure environmental impacts on educational outcomes?
    - Ex. EPA EJ index (does it capture all items that may impact educational outcomes)
7. How do we assess educational outcomes?
    - Ex. Are test scores a good indicator? How do we know if they are being impacted by the environment or something else (ex. SES)
8. Are the current EPA regulations of air pollution control effective? How can they be improve, in order to alleviate the health inpact of children in schools? 
9. Does air quality have the same impact as water quality on educational outcomes?
    - Comparative framework ?? (assessing educational outcomes and types of environmental conditions)
11. Should we look at a comparative analysis of enviroment and how it can potentially impact the school outcome for students in DAC and wealthy neighbourhoods.
12. Does schooling affect environmental outcomes or does environmental outcomes affect schooling?
13. How could land-use policy affect environmental racism for school-age children?
14. How do warehouses impact the environmental toxins in the air near schools? What are the afffects in children? 
15. Looking at environmental risk exposure through school district boundaries (ex. high pediatric asthma in certain school districts; change over time)
