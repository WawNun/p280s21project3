**Things To Consider**
- Things we will focus on here
- Things for future research

Brainstroming Session/ Class Discussion (04/21)
 -------
 1. What environmental factors significantly impact educational attainment?
    - Ex. aerosol particulate matter/respiratory hazards
3. In what ways do environmental factors impact educational success?
4. Are minorities and people of color more likely to be affected by environmental toxic exposure? 
5. How should we measure environmental impacts on educational outcomes?
    - Ex. EPA EJ index (does it capture all items that may impact educational outcomes)
7. How do we assess educational outcomes?
    - Ex. Are test scores a good indicator? How do we know if they are being impacted by the environment or something else (ex. SES)
8. Are the current EPA regulations of air pollution control effective? How can they be improve, in order to alleviate the health inpact of children in schools? 
9. Does air quality have the same impact as water quality on educational outcomes?
    - Comparative framework ?? (assessing educational outcomes and types of environmental conditions)
11. Should we look at a comparative analysis of enviroment and how it can potentially impact the school outcome for students in DAC and wealthy neighbourhoods.
12. Does schooling affect environmental outcomes or does environmental outcomes affect schooling?
13. How could land-use policy affect environmental racism for school-age children?
14. How do warehouses impact the environmental toxins in the air near schools? What are the afffects in children? 
15. Looking at environmental risk exposure through school district boundaries (ex. high pediatric asthma in certain school districts; change over time)

4/23/2021 Meeting: 
- Esteban: For Causality 
- Laura: Cons for Causality, maybe looking at associations would be easier. 
- Wajiha: potential air quality data from non-profit. Looking at Inland Empire 
- **Demographics, Ethniticy, Gender Income Variables were provided in SEDA**
Potential Forms of Measurements/datasets 
- Air Pollution 
- Project Proposal will be finalized in Hack md link and then transferred to GitHUb 

Questions: 
1. How do we pull student test performance from SEDA Website? 
Pending Decisions on which type of school (public, private, charter school) 
2. How do we define school districts? 

## How to Open Geoprocessing Crash Course File in JupyterLab

Fork the Repo [PBPL280s21](https://github.com/sjsrey/pbpl280s21)

Clone it in your JupyterLab using terminal. 

The main folder pbpl280s21 will appear on the side navigation bar. You can locate the geoprocessing demofile inside docsrc and go from there.

This will save alot of time instead copy pasting the code from the repo. Make sure to save any changes you make to the code.
