## :date: Group Meeting Log
------
`5/24/2021`

- [x]  **Group Meeting with Professor** 
 
 *Agenda: Discuss the issue of multiple legends on the choropleth map and how to create a score combining EJ and School performance.*
 
- Suggestions for the project
* Veroni method:
	* neighborhood (average census block groups) represented by polygons
	* Veroni method entails looking at the locations of schools subdivided within neighborhood polygons 
		* Closest school per polygon 	  
		* Link for visual rep: https://pysal.org/notebooks/lib/libpysal/voronoi.html 
	* Size of polygon depends on the spatial distribution of the points
	* Polygons will have score of schools with EJ Layer 
	* Veroni is another layer that we are adding to our map. 
	* Okay to combine NCES/SEDA/ACS/EJ Data by GeoId. Work from one file.
* Wednesday night Professor will do a demo on how to use the veroni method 
* Policy Perspective of Project: Purposes of project does not require policy recommendation- optional 
	* we can touch on policy implications  
		* Prof: Recommends taxing corporations that emit environmental toxins 	 	 
* Limitations of using Veroni method: 
	* Has constant population density - assumptions 
	* Distance measures as crow flies 
* Date Presentations Due forthcoming

`5/21/2021`
- [x]  **Group Meeting** 

*Agenda: Division of Work*
-  Wajiha and Sal and Esteban looking at SEDA variables and how to interpret 
-  How to access the correlation of the SEDA outcomes and the 
-  Working on the paper and presentation, drafting intro [Preeti will do the intro]
-  Create outline for presentation [Esteban and Laura],
-  Everyone will work on the manuscript; preeti will let us know when there are updates on the manuscript

`Upcoming Task`
- Look into the environmental policy for the inland empire for policy alt.


----
`5/19/2021`
- [x]  **In Class Group Meeting** 

 *Agenda: Discussion on progress made so far and possible questions.*

Laura: 
- create a smaller version of EJ data 
- Then save to local account 
- Use block group to join with EJ 
- Join Everything 
- For analysis: if you are going to look at assocation between demographic and cancer risk; then you should look at Demographics and Cancer risk and not demographics and Cancer Index 
- Look at what Percentile is

Wajiha: 
-  Use School Catchment join 
-  What's the relevant data area around a school? 
-  Think about how you expect the relationship to work between schools and [pollution for example]
-  One possible route for the project is descriptive. 
-  If descriptive then we should use precalculated index (it also depends on our research question)

`5/06/2021`
- [x]  **Group Meeting** 

 *Agenda: Finalized the project proposal in HackMD file.*
 
 ----
 
`4/23/2021` 
 - [x]   **Group Meeting** 

*Agenda: Discussion and review of data and literature for the study.*

 Potential Forms of Measurements
   -  Air Pollution ( what should be the ideal measure from EJscreen?)
   -  Demographics, Ethniticy, Gender Income Variables were provided in SEDA.
   
 Points Raised by Group Members:
   - Esteban: For Causality 
   - Laura: Cons for Causality, maybe looking at associations would be easier.  
   - Wajiha: potential air quality data from non-profit. Looking at Inland Empire 
    
  Future Deliverables:
   -  Project Proposal will be finalized in HackMD link and then transferred to GitHUb.

`04/21/2021`
 - [x]  **Inclass Group Meeting** 

*Agenda: Brainstroming Session/ Class Discussion*

List of questions generated during the discussion session:
 1. What environmental factors significantly impact educational attainment?
    - Ex. aerosol particulate matter/respiratory hazards
3. In what ways do environmental factors impact educational success?
4. Are minorities and people of color more likely to be affected by environmental toxic exposure? 
5. How should we measure environmental impacts on educational outcomes?
    - Ex. EPA EJ index (does it capture all items that may impact educational outcomes)
7. How do we assess educational outcomes?
    - Ex. Are test scores a good indicator? How do we know if they are being impacted by the environment or something else (ex. SES)
8. Are the current EPA regulations of air pollution control effective? How can they be improve, in order to alleviate the health inpact of children in schools? 
9. Does air quality have the same impact as water quality on educational outcomes?
    - Comparative framework ?? (assessing educational outcomes and types of environmental conditions)
11. Should we look at a comparative analysis of enviroment and how it can potentially impact the school outcome for students in DAC and wealthy neighbourhoods.
12. Does schooling affect environmental outcomes or does environmental outcomes affect schooling?
13. How could land-use policy affect environmental racism for school-age children?
14. How do warehouses impact the environmental toxins in the air near schools? What are the afffects in children? 
15. Looking at environmental risk exposure through school district boundaries (ex. high pediatric asthma in certain school districts; change over time)
